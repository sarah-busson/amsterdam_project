## Project Description
When I arrived in Amsterdam a few weeks ago, I felt like the capital was a model in terms of ecology.
I was impressed by the amount of bikes (!) and especially the road infrastructure to accomodate those. 
I also have the feeling that the city of Amsterdam matches my personal values regarding the environment.

But I was wondering if that feeling was true or just an impression. Are the Netherlands resting on this image or are they really improving ?

## Questions & Hypotheses
**Are the Netherlands a model in the compliance with the 2015 Paris Agreement and its engagement toward the European climate goals ?**
 * What are the ecologic goals for 2020 ? Does NL respect them ?
 * What are its strength ? Its weaknesses ?
 * What are the possibles improvements ?

## Dataset
The 2 sources I used come from :
 * https://klimaatmonitor.databank.nl/ for the data about the gas emissions in / by NL.
 * https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/downloads.html for the data about the energy sources in NL.

At first, I tried to use datasets from the city of Amsterdam but as those were too incomplete, I thought it would be more relevant to use data from the whole country.

## Workflow
 * First, I thought about the main topic I wanted to talk about, and narrow it to my main questions.
 * Then I created my Trello Board
 * I first  looked for information about my topic : the Paris Agreement, the European goals for 2020...
 * Once I knew the kind of data I needed to answer my questions, I looked for databases. More than work on the datasets, this part took me the longest time because I had to clean most of them before knowing if I'd be able to get some relevant information out of it.
 * With my finals datasets, I cleaned them, and treat the informations it contained.
 * While doing this, I wrote the insights that I could clearly see and helped me answer my questions.
 * When I gathered all the informations, I've been able to start preparing my presentation.
 
## Organization
See link for Trello

I tried to organize my repository as I organized my local files, separating the sources, the 'good' datasets from the others ...
